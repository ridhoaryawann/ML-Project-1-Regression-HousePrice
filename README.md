# 🏡 House Inspection for Loan Evaluation — Simple Regression Modeling

## 📘 Overview

This project presents a **very simple regression modeling example** focused on house inspection data, which serves as a **first step** in evaluating loan eligibility. The aim is to explore how basic linear regression models perform in predicting a target variable (e.g., house price or quality), which can help **financial institutions** assess a borrower’s loan capability.

---

## 🏦 Business Context

For banks and financial institutions, the condition and value of a property are critical indicators when approving a **loan** or **mortgage**. An accurate estimate of the house's worth based on inspection features supports:

- Assessing **borrower creditworthiness**
- Understanding the **collateral value**
- Improving **risk evaluation and decision-making**

This notebook uses simple regression techniques to demonstrate the modeling potential of inspection data in **automated loan assessments**.

## ⚙️ Models Compared & Results

This notebook compares six linear regression-based models. Each model is briefly explained and evaluated using **R² Score**, along with visualizations of **prediction accuracy** and **residuals**.

---

### 1. **Linear Regression**

**Concept**:  
Fits a straight line through the data by minimizing squared errors. Assumes linear relationships between predictors and the target.

**Result**:
- **R² Score**: `0.829`
- Performs decently but may underfit complex patterns.
- Visualization: Slight underprediction for high-value properties.

---

### 2. **Lasso Regression**

**Concept**:  
Linear model with **L1 regularization**. Shrinks some coefficients to zero — effectively performing automatic **feature selection**.

**Result**:
- **R² Score**: `0.826`
- Similar to Linear Regression but more interpretable.
- Useful when reducing model complexity is important.

---

### 3. **Ridge Regression**

**Concept**:  
Linear model with **L2 regularization**. Penalizes large coefficients to reduce overfitting.

**Result**:
- **R² Score**: `0.829`
- Matches Linear Regression in performance.
- More stable when multicollinearity exists among features.

---

### 4. **ElasticNet**

**Concept**:  
A combination of Lasso and Ridge (L1 + L2 regularization). Balances between **feature selection** and **coefficient shrinkage**.

**Result**:
- **R² Score**: `0.828`
- Slightly improved generalization.
- Good choice when unsure whether L1 or L2 is more appropriate.

---

### 5. **ARDRegression** (Automatic Relevance Determination)

**Concept**:  
Bayesian linear regression with automatic shrinkage of irrelevant features. Identifies which features are most relevant to predictions.

**Result**:
- **R² Score**: `0.829`
- Similar to Ridge in accuracy, with a Bayesian twist.
- Can handle feature uncertainty well.

---

### 6. **SGDRegressor** (Stochastic Gradient Descent)

**Concept**:  
Optimizes a linear model using gradient descent — efficient for large datasets and online learning. Supports L1, L2, or ElasticNet penalties.

**Result**:
- **R² Score**: `0.828`
- Lightweight and scalable.
- Slightly less stable if not carefully tuned.

---

## 📊 Visual Insights

Each model includes the following visualizations:
- **Actual vs Predicted Plot**  
  Displays how close the predictions are to the real values.
- **Residual Plot**  
  Helps detect patterns in prediction errors.
- **Coefficient Weights**  
  Shows the importance of each feature in linear-based models.

These help both technical and business stakeholders understand **how the models behave**, even in early development stages.
